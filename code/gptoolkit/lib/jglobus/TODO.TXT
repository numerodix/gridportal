GENERAL
=======

Todo:

Misc. Higher Priority:
	- Improve file:// url handling
	- Implement all Gram 1.6 features (credential refresh)
        - fix unix scripts in the fixCommandLine thig to use ' instead of "
	- Update MyProxy to support latest version of MyProxy
	- Implement a couple of new programs cert-renew?

Misc. Lower Priority:
        - GSI-SSH client - just for starting simple jobs.
	- Fix/update/decide what to do with basic MDS class.
          o use jndi or netscape libs directly
	- Add '/' to the end of urls (look into this)
	- Provide a generic Gass open call somewhere
	- Continue to clean up HTTP protocol stuff - there is no 
          need for GASSProtocol class, etc.
	- Improve on error reporting in GASS server.
	- Globus-replica-catalog command line tool
	- Internationalize more components

Other (and CVS related):
        - Add the demo.xml file for quick creation of the demos - sining
          the jar files, generating a key. put in cvs the .jnlp files.
        - clean up the CVS:
          o SortedVector?

Security Update Notes
=====================

The following packages/libraries are not currently updated to use the new
security library:

 o pkcs11
 o the old gui version of grid-proxy-init or myproxy 

OTHER IDEAS
===========

Low Priority Items:

 - Gass server: the support for redirected input streams? (and tail -f
   functionality?)
 - Implement Replica Managment
 - Implement a persistent seed generator?
 - Improve applets. Add documentation about how to use them and how to sign
   applets in general. (very low priority)
 - Add better JavaDoc descriptions to the ConfigUtil.java 
 - MDS: add support fo referrals
 - Improve the setup program 
 - Batch and script files to check for JAVA_HOME and if set to use it
   otherwise just call java.
