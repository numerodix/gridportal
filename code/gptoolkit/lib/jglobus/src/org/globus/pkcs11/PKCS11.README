The classes contained within this directory and the tools directory below it 
will not compile by default.  In order to compile them, you must:

1.) Download the pkcs11 wrappers from IBM at
    http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/pkcs and place the
    zip file (jpkcs11.zip) in the lib directory of the cog base directory 

2.) Make sure that you have the proper drivers/shared libraries for your
    pkcs11 device installed and your environment setup appropriately (see
    "NATIVE LIBRARY ENVIRONMENT SETUP" below). For the Java iButton on Windows,
    this is ftp://ftp.dalsemi.com/pub/crypto/pkcs11/release1.01/WinPKCS.exe.

3.) Use ant to compile. Ant will automatically try to compile the pkcs11
    package once it detects the jpkcs11.zip file is present in the lib/
    directory.

Note: only ant is supported at this time -- the makefile in this directory
      is a dummy makefile


NATIVE LIBRARY ENVIRONMENT SETUP:

Which native library will be used when running programs using these classes can
be specified in two ways: 

1. add the following line to cog.properties:
   pkcs11lib = nameofyourlib 

   example:
	#Use the iButton Windows drivers
   	pkcs11lib=dspkcs

2. if this is not specified, the code will check for the system property
   PKCS11_LIB

The default if neither is specified is "dspkcs" which is the name of
the ibutton library.

To make sure Java can find your native library, you must point your environment
to the directory that holds it.  You can achieve this in several ways, some
of which are dependant on your OS:

A. Include the native library directory in the java.library.path.
   example:
   	java ... -Djava.library.path=C:\WINNT\system32\drivers ...

B. If you are using Windows, you can make sure the native library is in a
   directory which is listed in your PATH variable.

C. If you are using Unix/Linux you can set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable
   to include the the required directory.
