REQUEST

We request that you notify us so we can keep track of the use of the Java
CoG Kit, as this directly affects our ability to motivate additional
coding activities. Please, be so kind to send an e-mail to
gregor@mcs.anl.gov with the following description:

Project Name: 
Institution: 
Main Contact:
E-mail: 
Web Page: 
Description of your project: 


Furthermore, if your project uses Java CoG Kit, or you use a software
package that uses Java CoG Kit, we require that you cite the following
paper in your publication:

A Java Commodity Grid Kit, Gregor von Laszewski, Ian Foster, Jarek
Gawor, Peter Lane, Concurrency and Computation: Practice and
Experience, pages 643-662, Volume 13, Issue 8-9,
2001. {http://www.globus.org/cog/java/}
 

We also would like to be notified about publications that you write
while and are using Java CoG, as this will help us to document the
usefulness. We like to feature these articles or your project information 
with your permission on our Web site. 

If you have difficulties with these requirements listed
above please contact us.

SURVEY 

In order to serve the community better and to document our usefulness,
it is important that you participate in the user survey for Java
CoG. It would help us if you can send the following survey to
gregor@mcs.anl.gov. This may include tools, classes, APIs, and
applications that use CoG. If you know about components or services
that use CoG indirectly through another package or tool this would be
helpful as well.

We like to publish a small web page with a one paragraph description
of your project. Furthermore, we like to inquire what other features
you like to see next. Here the suggested format with a small example:

Project Name:            Computed Microtomography 
Project Contact:         Gregor von Laszewski (gregor@mcs.anl.gov) 
Technical Contact:   Gregor von Laszewski 
Description: 
 
This project tries to advance the infrastructure used at photon
sources to obtain computed microtomographies in real-time. The images
are rendered on a supercomputer accessible through the
Grid. Collaborative display of the rendered data is possible. (you can
write more here if you like)

Web page:  http://www.mcs.anl.gov/xray 

Use of CoG: We use the job startup, MDS, and
GRAM GUI.

Desired Features: Please make the Gecco workflow scheduler available
which was once part of CoG.

Do you have JavaBeans for the CoG Kit you like to share?: Yes: A bean
for submitting multiple Gram Jobs similar to Duroc but is for GRAM
Jobs. Thank you for integrating it in the current release.

Publicity:  [x] yes, you can place this information on the Web
