# $File: src/gridportal/INSTALL

1. In order to run GRIDportal, you must have Webware installed and WebKit
   running on your system. The installation guide for WebKit[*] is
   located at the Webware website and I will not duplicate it here. You
   should set up WebKit as a system service running under its own user
   account.

	 You will also need to install pyGlobus[**].

2. Next, create a working directory as per the instructions in the WebKit
   install guide, for instance:

    $ python /path/to/Webware/bin/MakeAppWorkDir -l -cvsignore \
    -c context gridportal

   The directory structure inside gridportal/ should now look like this:

    404Text.txt Cache/ ErrorMsgs/ Logs/ WebKit.cgi lib/ AppServer 
    Configs/ Launch.py Sessions/ context/

3. Now unpack the GRIDportal source code and copy the contents of
   src/gridportal/ to /path/to/context/.

4. Next, open /path/to/Webware/WebKit/Configs/Application.config and add
   under ''Contexts'':

    'default': '/opt/gridportal/context',

5. Now restart the WebKit application server and you should be able to
   access gridportal. The exact URL will depend on your webserver/Adapter
   configuration.

6. I'm assuming you created a special user account for webware/webkit.
   You should now create a homedir for this user. The homedir is crucial,
   because this is where GRIDportal will write all of its data. For
   example:

    $ mkdir /var/webware

   Now make sure this user owns the homedir:

    $ chown webware:webware -R /var/webware

7. Finally, set this url in the conf_main.py config file in the root 
   gridportal directory:

    env_homepath = "/var/webware"
