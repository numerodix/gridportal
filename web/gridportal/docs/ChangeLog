29 September 2005, Martin Matusiak:

+++ release 0.5.3
A feature release above all, some bugfixes
+ Authentication model change from proxy upload to myproxy integration
+ GRIDportal now deployed with GridPortalToolkit
	(http://gridportal.dynalias.org/gptoolkit/www/)
+ Documentation added for the use of GridPortalToolkit


23 August 2005, Martin Matusiak:

+++ authentication switched from proxy upload to myproxy
In the old model, a user would have to generate a proxy locally and upload this
to the portal for every session. The new model uses myproxy as a credential 
storage repository. With the new GridPortalToolkit client application, the user 
will create a certificate and register it with myproxy, all done locally.

This adds a new dependency in the form of pyGlobus.

+++ javascript menu replaced with SmartMenus5.5
problems with transmenu: 
- a bit cumbersome loading with animated slideout
- menu broken in Opera, buggy in Konqueror

SmartMenus was made to mimmick transmenu as much as possible, even though it 
looks slightly different. SmartMenus is bundled with test results from a wide 
variety of browsers and the menu was tested successfully in IE6, Opera8, 
Firefox1.0.4 and Konqueror3.4.0.
