		The signed certificate is uploaded, along with the username and password with which the user registered at GRIDportal.
		<br><br>
		The certificate is now stored with myProxy. myProxy requires a username/password combo for any given credential stored there, so we use the username/password we already have.

		The myProxy client utility used to store credentials with myProxy, <i>myproxy-init</i> is an interactive program. Instead, we can use the  <i>Authentication.pm</i> perl module from <a href="http://gridport.net">gridport</a> and write a simple client to do this.

			<h3>The security angle</h3>
			Once again, the certificate is transferred to GRIDportal. It is then stored in myProxy and removed from GRIDportal. To secure the transfer we can use https.
