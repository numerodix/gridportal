Preface
\layout Standard

This document is intended for the reader who is familiar with GRIDportal.
 For an explanation of concepts and the system itself, please see the White
 Paper.
\layout Chapter

What to test?
\layout Section

The frontend perspective
\layout Standard

In the frontend perspective, GRIDportal interacts with WebKit, Webware and
 Apache.
 The level of complexity in this construct, as regards GRIDportal, is rather
 low.
 It is a question of correct configuration of the http server and the consequenc
e is that either it works or it does not.
 Thus testing the frontend is fairly trivial, once the http server has been
 configured, one can tell whether GRIDportal operates correctly.
\layout Standard

Consequently, no testing was done of the frontend beyond verifying that
 it does serve pages correctly.
\layout Section

The backend perspective
\layout Standard

Given that GRIDportal is a component of a greater whole, it would make sense
 to consider how it should be tested and exactly what should undergo testing.
 GRIDportal is closely linked to the NorduGrid/ARC middleware, it depends
 entirely on services supplied by the middleware.
 Thus there are two apparent perspectives to testing.
\layout Itemize

Integration test to determine how well GRIDportal works as part of the software
 stack.
\layout Itemize

Isolation test where the deployment environment is largely disregarded to
 test the functionality of GRIDportal alone.
\layout Standard

An integration test makes a lot of sense, because the purpose of the project
 is to integrated GRIDportal into the runtime environment and verify that
 it is functional.
 An integration test will also uncover stability issues with the middleware
 and possibly other components further down the software stack.
 This can be considered beneficial, as it brings out faults in the entire
 system and not just GRIDportal.
 However, it can also be seen to hamper the testing, as stability issues
 in the middleware or elsewhere could conceal problems with GRIDportal.
\layout Standard

To get around that issue, an isolation test could be used to determine GRIDporta
l's stability and performance without relying on the middleware or other
 software.
 However, such a test would have to be far more complicated and probably
 would not uncover many serious errors which were not already discovered
 in the integration test.
 Fine grained isolation testing could be accomplished with unit testing,
 but the way GRIDportal was designed, it simply does not lend itself to
 unit testing very well, and choosing that avenue would imply simulating
 parts of the middleware.
 The reason why this is so is that GRIDportal does not contain much business
 logic, it is a gateway between the user and the middleware.
 So it consists mostly of functions which either
\layout Itemize

interact with the middleware, or
\layout Itemize

return html code,
\layout Standard

thus writing unit tests would soon become very obscure and tedious.
 Consequently, it was decided to scrap the isolation test entirely and only
 undertake integration testing.
\layout Chapter

Test procedures
\layout Section

Integration test
\layout Subsection

Automated testing
\layout Standard

No facility was created to automate the integration test.
 Such a system could be constructed, it would have to contain a web browser
 and logic to verify that navigating the GRIDportal web site a certain way
 returns expected results.
 But this kind of system would most likely take a long time to build, it
 would also be terribly inconvenient to maintain as GRIDportal evolves and
 the html pages retrieved by the test system change slightly in appearance.
\layout Subsection

Manual testing
\layout Standard

So in the absence of automated testing, the apparent alternative is to do
 manual testing.
 The manual testing follows familiar use cases and experiences GRIDportal
 just as a typical user would.
 It first sets certain criteria for input data or outcome, and then proceeds
 to test the full functionality of GRIDportal.
 (As navigation in GRIDportal is handled through buttons tied to html forms,
 it simply means testing all of the functions operated by these buttons.)
\layout Standard

Since GRIDportal is a small website (judging by the number of pages), we
 have the luxury of testing all of its functionality in this test.
\layout Subsubsection

Limitations
\layout Standard

Special scenarios geared at unveiling uncommon errors which the user is
 unlikely to encounter are not tested (such as trying inconceivably extreme
 input values or purposely trying to provoke unexpected situations).
 This should be tested in the context of an isolation test instead, since
 an isolation test is more suited to yield a thorough run down of the bugs
 in each function.

Tests results

Integration test
\layout Subsection

Typical use cases
\layout Standard

BLAST testing was impaired by the lack of installed BLAST databases on the
 grid, so only blastp and blastn jobs were possible to run.
 On top of that, only data sets for blastp were available.
 But given that all blast* variants are very similar in how jobs are executed
 and all jobs are launched by the same binary, testing one BLAST variant
 is highly significant to the whole.
\layout Standard

In testing Matlab, only a trivial data set was available.
\layout Standard

Where no outcome is stated, the test finished without error.

Session handling
\layout Standard

A few tests were run to verify that session handling is functional.
\layout Standard

While it was stated that the testing would not deliberately provoke unexpected
 results, a user who mistakenly chooses the wrong file to upload as a proxy
 will receive a surprising outcome.

\layout Subsection

HTTP transfer constraints
\layout Standard

An inherent weakness of GRIDportal is handling of big input/output files.
 All file transfers are done over HTTP, thus network speed and congestion
 can easily disrupt an ongoing transfer and there is no function to resume
 a transfer so the user is forced to start over and try again.
\layout Standard

Connection speeds are given as top extremes, so any transfer is very unlikely
 to reach the speed indicated.
